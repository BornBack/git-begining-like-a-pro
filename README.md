## lets-git

0. we have to create a repository in github, which is optional, we can directly start work in our local machine
    - git init
    - will create local master branch

1. you will obviously develop some cool applications or whatever, solve some tough problems through code
    - so you will write code, change them, test them
    - anything you do, you should mark the changes - git diff, git log, git status
    - want to track things by git? start by adding them, each file or all - git add .
    - what have you done, can you explain it to yourself? that's commit - git commit -m "linkin park - what I've done, I'm commiting by myself"

1. main source will be sent/uploaded/synced with github finally
